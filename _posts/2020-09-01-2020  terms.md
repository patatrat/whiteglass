2020 is over half way though and its been pretty terrible so far. 

To make it slightly easier, here are some new words and sayings that we've had to create during the first half of 2020.

## DONALD DUCKING

Attending a video meeting without pants on. 

 ```code
 "Let me just turn up the heat, I'm Donald Ducking it today".
  ```

## COVIDIOT 

Someone that ignores health advice, refuses to wear masks when required and posts conspiracy nonsense on facebook about Bill Gates, UN, Plandemics and 5G.

```code
 "Did you see what your Covidiot cousin posted on facebook last night? 1080 causes COVID."
  ```

## YOU'RE ON MUTE

Heard up to 50 times a day when on video calls. This is often followed by 'Can you hear me now?'.

```code
 "Steve. We can't hear you. 
 Steve mate, You're on mute. 
 No, still can't hear you. 
 Is the mic plugged in? 
 Maybe you just need to reset your computer. 
 Steve, we are just going to start without you."
  ```


## WORKING FROM HAMMOCK

Taking a more leisurely approach to working from home.

```code
"Anyone seen Tim online today?" 
"Nah, he's WFH - Working from Hammock".
  ```
