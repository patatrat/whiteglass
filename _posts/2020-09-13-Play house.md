A weeks ago I given a surprise weekend task when we discovered a playhouse being sold for cheap on facebook by someone living close by. 20 mins after seeing it listed online, we were over there, pulling it apart and loading it on a trailer.

The next day and after spending 150 bucks worth on landscaping timber and some new stainless hardware to replace the old rusted parts (hinges etc) we are underway. Our property, like many in Wellington, is on quite a slope, plus the spot that I chose was a space where I have just removed a large and old [Karo tree](http://www.aucklandbotanicgardens.co.nz/plants-for-auckland/plants/pittosporum-crassifolium/) which had a solid and thick root system - so digging the foundation out took the better part of the morning. Luckily I had some help.

I waterblasted and cleaned up the floor of the playhouse and screwed it down to the foundations.

It is starting to come together.

A few hours after starting - we are done.

After a few days of the girls playing in it, it was clear I needed to make a bit of a step down to make it easier for the small kids to get in and out - so, the next job was the world's smallest deck. I also cleaned up around the house - removing a couple of old compost bins, flattening the ground and sowing some grass.

Final task was painting. I was keen to minimize how much money I put into this (although I was starting to regret how much time I'd spent!), so paint was just what we happened to have in the basement - boring and white. And the final touch - some house numbers.

And now we are done. And it is looking better than the main house - so I better get on to painting that at some point.
