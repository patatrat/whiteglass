Welcome! 

I've had this domain name for a while now. With a less common name like Radomski, it was pretty easy to get a local domain (although the .com version was taken ages ago), but I never had a clear idea of what I would use it for. Over the years I've tried a few different things including a wordpress site, but I wanted to try something easy and cheap - a cloud native approach. So, that's what this is - a very simple and light website powered by Jekyll and hosted on AWS S3 buckets. Compared to hosting a VM somewhere (and all the additional work that comes with keeping that alive), this approach is pretty simple and more importantly, cheap. I've spent 50 cents so far on hosting.

Don't expect this site to be updated reguarly. I'll put posts up when I have content and time, but there might be long breaks between.
