I was given a surprise weekend task over the weekend when we discovered a playhouse being sold for cheap on facebook by someone living close by. 20 mins after seeing it listed online, we were over there, pulling it apart and loading it on a trailer.

The next day and after spending 150 bucks worth on landscaping timber and some new stainless hardware to replace the old rusted parts (hinges etc) we are underway. Our property, like many in Wellington, is on quite a slope, plus the spot that I chose was a space where I have just removed a large and old [Karo tree](http://www.aucklandbotanicgardens.co.nz/plants-for-auckland/plants/pittosporum-crassifolium/) which had a soild and thick root system - so digging the foundation out took the better part of the morning. Luckly I had some help.
